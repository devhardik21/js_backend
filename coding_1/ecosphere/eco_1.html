            <h4>About Carbon Footprint</h4>
            <p>A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (mainly CO₂) released into the atmosphere due to human activities like driving, electricity use, and consumption habits. Every action that consumes energy contributes to it, impacting climate change and global warming. Excessive CO₂ emissions trap heat, leading to rising temperatures, extreme weather, and environmental damage. Major sources include fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial production</p>

        <div class="cards" id="history">
            <h4>Eye-Opening Carbon Footprint Data</h4>
            <p>🌎 Global Average Carbon Footprint: ~ 4.5 tons of CO₂ per person per year.<br>
                🇺🇸 USA: ~ 16 tons per person (one of the highest).<br>
                🇮🇳 India: ~ 2 tons per person.<br>
                🚗 One liter of petrol releases ~2.3 kg of CO₂ into the air.<br>
                💡 A single 60W bulb left on for 12 hours emits ~3.5 kg of CO₂.<br>
                ✈️ A round-trip flight from NYC to London = ~986 kg of CO₂ per person!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cards" id="calculation">
            <h4>How Its Calculated</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Transportation 🚗✈️ → The fuel burned by cars, buses, and planes emits CO₂. A petrol car emits about 2.3 kg of CO₂ per liter of fuel.</li>
                <li>Electricity Usage 💡 → The type of energy source matters—coal-based electricity emits more CO₂ than renewable energy.</li>
                <li>Food & Diet 🍔🥗 → Meat-heavy diets have a higher footprint due to livestock farming emissions, while plant-based diets are lower in CO₂ impact.</li>
                <li>Shopping & Waste 🛍️♻️ → Buying new products, especially electronics and fast fashion, increases emissions, while recycling reduces them.</li></ul>
